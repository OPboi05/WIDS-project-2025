# WIDS-project-2025

## Week 1 : Studied the basics of Python and Statistics
### Python 
I studied about numpy , pandas and matplotlib using youtube tutorials and solved an Assigment for practice

### Probability and Statistics
Reviewed many concepts upto JEE level and studied many more topics like Random variable, Common probability distributions(discrete and continous), Expectation, Variance, Joint distribution, Moment Generating function, Covariance and Correlation, Multivariate Normal distribution, Probability Inequalities(Markov, Chebyshev and Cantelli's Inequalitiy) and Convergence, Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit theorem.
Solved one assigment for practice as well.

## Week 2: Studied the basics of trading

### Time Series analysis
Studied about stationary time series, Different models(AR(auto regressive) , MA(moving average), ARMA).
Also studied the test for checking stationarity of a time series(ADF(Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test) and how to implement ADF test in python.
Also studied about Cointegration and a test to check if a pair of two series are cointegrated using the CADF(Cointegrated Augmented Dickey-Fuller test)

### Regression and OLS
*Studied about linear regression(Ordinary Least Square) and implemented it in python. 
*Studied about ADF statistic, p-value, confidence interval(critical values).
*Calculated half life of mean-reverting series using OLS. 
*Calculated hedge ratio using OLS.
